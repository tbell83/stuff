## How does “rhythm” come into play when scheduling a meeting?  You should become aware of the rhythm of your client so you understand their business.

Rhythm is important when scheduling a meeting because each business operates at its own, unique pace.  When scheduling a meeting, it's best to choose the times when you and the rest of the attendees are least likely to be interrupted or distracted, or under a lighter workload than they might be on other days.

## What is the value of taking meeting minutes during a meeting?  What about their value after a meeting?  What do you do with them?

Taking minutes during a meeting can be a valuable exercise.  Taking minutes can help ensure that all the attendees of the meeting are all aware of what the meeting is trying to accomplish, and what is being discussed.  They are also a useful reference after the meeting, and can be distributed to both attendees and those who may not have been present at the meeting so that everyone is clear on what was covered, as well as what peoples responsibilites are.  

## What are the meeting leaders’ responsibilities?  How will you select your meeting leader?  Do you think that rotating the leader will work in your group?

The meeting leader is responsible for ensuring that the agenda set forth for the meeting is adhered to, that the ground rules are followed, and that the meeting does not run beyond the timeboxed scope.  Meeting leaders can be selected in a variety of ways, such as position, or rotation.  Having a rotating meeting leader gives everyone on the team to be in charge of the meeting and allows each team member an opportunity to grow their leadership skills, which may or may not be a benefit, depending on the composition of the team.

## What are softening words – how and why should you use them?

Softening words are words that do not make absolute statements, but allow for alternate possibilities.  They allow the speaker more leeway in case they need to backpedal and at some point in the future change their opinion.  Also, they make the listener more receptive to your suggestions.

## Action items, task, and commitments – how should you follow up on these items?

You should follow up on your action items as you complete them, as to alleviate any worry or anxiety you may be creating for the person who is counting on your completion of these tasks.  Follow up on your action items either by sending an email or bringing up the status of the commitment at the next meeting.
